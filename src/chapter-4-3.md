Understanding the power of feedback is essential for giving and receiving effective feedback in the workplace. In this chapter, we'll explore the impact of feedback on individuals and organizations.

However, when feedback is delivered poorly or not at all, it can lead to disengagement, demotivation, and reduced job satisfaction. By understanding the impact of feedback on individuals, organizations can create a culture of continuous learning and development.
